Analyzing the Gapminder dataset

## Problem 1
Take the Gapminder Test: http://forms.gapminder.org/s3/test-2018.
What score did you receive? Did any of the answers surprise you?
Choose a question from the test, re-state it, and answer it using visualization and summarization. Provide a
figure and any relevant output with your answer.

I scored 8/13 (61%) in the test. I think it is because I had a lot of preconceived ideas about the world and 
underestimated the improvement in the world. Also, the media around showcases more about what is wrong with the 
world as compared to what good is happening in the world. The answers that surprised me was that 60% of the girls 
in low-income countries have completed the fifth grade. Also, the fact that 80% of the world’s 1-year-old children 
today have been vaccinated against some disease. Both of these are great news.

#### How many of the world’s 1-year-old children today have been vaccinated against some disease?

From the plot above, it can be observed that the percent of one-year-olds that are vaccinated has increased over 
the years. It can be observed from the plot that today more than 80% of the one-year-olds are vaccinated just as 
mentioned in the answer.

## Problem 2
Visualize the distribution of income (GDP / capita) across countries and continents, and how the distribution
of income changes over time.
Interpret the visualization and what you notice. Are they any notable trends and/or deviations from that
trend?
What caveats apply to your conclusions?

From the plot above it can be observed that the income of all the continents has increased over the years.
The continent with the highest income is Europe and the one with the lowest is Africa. Asia had income higher 
than Europe for a short period around the 1970s and then the income of Europe was the highest again.
The income has increased slowly until 1950 and rapidly after.

In the plot above the income of every country over time is displayed and the color of the plot is the continent 
to which the country belongs. On observing the plot for the United  Arab Emirates, we can see that the income 
increased and reached its highest around the 1950s and then started decreasing till 2000s and then increased 
again. This may be due to oil prices. This similar trend can be seen in all the oil-producing countries. China, 
South Korea, and India had low income but near 2000 the income increased rapidly. The income of most of the 
African countries increased near the 2000s.

The above plot shows the income of the countries for each continent over time.

The above plot shows the income of all the countries over time. The caveats in the conclusion is that in the 
plots I am only considering the income in the form of gdp per capita. Not considering the population of the 
country. 


## Problem 3
Use visualization to investigate the relationship between income (GDP / capita), life expectancy, and child
mortality over time. How does each measure change over time within each continent?
Interpret your visualizations, noting any trends and/or outliers.


Based on the plots above, it can be observed that child mortality has decreased over-time in all the continents. 
This can be due to increased importance to health, technological and advances in medical science. 
Similarly, life expectancy increased over time in all the continents. It can also be seen from the plots that 
income has increased over time in all the continents. The increase in income across all the continents also 
explains the trend in child mortality and life expectancy.
In the plots from all the continents, the is an outlier around the 1920s in life expectancy. 
There may be an epidemic or some natural disaster or war during that time due to which life expectancy 
decreased. Child mortality decreased first in Europe and the last in Africa. Also, income is highest in 
Europe and lowest in Africa.

## Problem 4
Choose two variables you have not investigated yet, and visualize their distributions, their relationship with
each other, and how these change over time.
Interpret your visualizations, noting any trends and/or outliers.

For this question, I considered the distribution of population and percent of self-employment across continents 
over the years. The population has increased for all the continents. Also, over the years self-employment has 
decreased. Self-employment was the highest in Africa. This makes sense as before the industrial revolution, most 
of the low-income countries were farmers and cattle rearers. So they were self-employed. Over the years 
self-employment decreased and people started working for corporations.


## Problem 5
Did you use static or interactive plots to answer the previous problems?
Explore the data using the interactive visualization tools at https://www.gapminder.org/tools, and watch
the TED talk “The best stats you’ve ever seen” at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w.
Discuss the advantages, disadvantages, and relative usefulness of using interactive/dynamic visualizations
versus static visualizations.

I used static plots to answer previous problems.

Advantages of interactive plots:
- Since it shows movement in data it is better in conveying a story in the form of data.
- In interactive plots, if we are interested in a particular aspect, (like a particular country) it can be selected and analyzed
    better as the selected aspect is highlighted. This helps focus on a particular thing at once.
- It is better to use when there are a lot of variables.
- Makes it easier to interpret and understand the information

Disadvantages of interactive plots:
- It can get complex to build.
- It needs the attention of the audience to understand the data at every stage.
- It cannot be used for publications like research papers or books.
- If the plot is fairly simple, a static plot will take less time to convey the information as compared to an interactive plot

Advantages of the static plot:
- Comparatively simple to build.
- A static plot can be published in research papers and books.
- Conveys all the information at once.
- Better in visualizing plots with fewer number (3 or less than 3) variable interactions.

Disadvantages of Static plots:
- In case of a large number of variables, static plots would either have too much in one plot which would make it difficult to 
 read and interpret or it would you multiple plots to convey the information which would make it difficult to understand
 the relationship between the variables.
